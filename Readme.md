# Django Demo App

## Bt Real Estate

This app demonstrates basic to intermediate DJango technique and usage. I wrote it as part of a Django course I did over on Packt. It's a good app to learn Django from - I am quite good now. It comes with prebuilt HTML and I worked through the materials and converted it into Django - and coded the views and models and routing with the urls.

I included a Dockerfile and docker-compose to run the app easily with a SQL server (MySQL 5) - Just run the docker-compose up. It should work fine - I needed some time to configure it but I think it's good now.

The data is seeded as well so no problems with a empty app - the Admin area is the primary input page, the login is shyam, password is passw0rd.
